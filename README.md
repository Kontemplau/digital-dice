# Digital Dice
*Program for a Dice on Arduino Uno*

The Dice is built from 9 LEDs, which display the faces of the dice.
When the button is pushed an animation is played and a new face shown.
With the help of a 9V battery you can play on the go.

## Hardware

The project is powered by an Arduino Uno R3 that is connected to pin headers on the back side of the board.

The LEDs and the button are connected to the following pins:

    A3  A4   6
    A0   5   7
    A5   4   2
        (3)

Each LED has a resistor of 270Î© to limit the current.

The 9V battery is connected to the Vin pin.
To prevent backflow into the battery do not connect the battery and the USB cable at the same time.

## Software

The dice logic is implemented in the `Game` class.
The roll animation is created by the `Animation` class.

The seed of the generator of the random numbers is saved in the EEPROM and gets updated on every reset.
This ensures a different animation on every roll.
The random numbers are generated by Xorshift by default, but the generator can easily be changed.

The game loop runs 100 times a second.
